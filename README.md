### A "server-less" water and calorie tracker using react, styled-components, local storage 

All information is stored in local storage, hence there is no one watching over your shoulders ( *coughs* mark zuckerberg )  
about your health. You are your boss üòé

#### [LIVE DEMO](https://makaravind.github.io/WaFoo/)

# Stack (A complete UI web app)
- React
- Style Components
- Material-UI
- Local Storage

> And yeah, latest and greatest, CSS-GRID for layouts (I may have over used it, But I love it ‚ù§)

# Set up
- cd wafoo
- yarn start / npm start

# Contribution 
This is a learner app which meant to provide best practices, and how to use libraries with React. If you think there is something
missing, feel free to pull-request ‚ù§
