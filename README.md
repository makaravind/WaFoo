## A "server-less" water and calorie tracker using react, styled-components, local storage

All information is stored in local storage, hence there is no one watching over your shoulders ( *coughs* mark zuckerberg )  
about your health. You are your boss 😎

# Stack (A complete UI web app)
- React
- Style Components
- Material-UI
- Local Storage

# Set up

- yarn start / npm start

# Contribution 
This is a learner app which meant to provide best practices, and how to use libraries with React. If you think there is something
missing, feel free to pull-request ❤
